This is my blackjack game with unit tests and integration tests. The game has 6 classes:
Table, Card, Deck, Player, Dealer, BlackJackPlayer.


Table:
The Table class is the driver and mirrors the integration testing, so there are no actual
feasible unit tests for this class. This classes is responsible for taking input from the player,
giving the dealer or player cards, determining if game is over, and showing the winner.

Deck:
The Deck class holds the cards in the deck

Card:
The Card is responsible for holding the value and suit of a particular card.

Player:
The Player class is responsible for holding the name of the player as well as the hand the
player has. The Player class can add cards to the player's hand and get the total points for
their hand. Dealer and BlackJackPlayer both extend this class.

BlackJackPlayer:
The is the class that the actual player of the game will be using. This class holds the info
to whether the player CAN play the game (score < 21) or if they WANT to play the game (stands).

Dealer:
The Dealer class is responsible mainly for keeping track if the dealer can keep playing.
Once the dealer's points is at or equal to 16, the dealer stops playing.
